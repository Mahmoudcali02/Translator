Project Title:
Languigi: Translate your favourite phrases abroad in the most accurate way

Website Title and Description
Languigi allows our user to translate their favourite phrases into the most popular languages in an instant. Using Yandex to do so, we managed to have the most accurate usage of words in day to day lives to impress locals while you tour different countries.

The website can be found at the following address

Who is our audience?
Tourists. But can be used by other people (business / holiday makers etc).

User Story:
As a tourist I want to be able to quickly translate phrases and words I want to try and pro-nounce or show locals in order to communicate efficently.

What is the problem the product is going to address?
Since this is a travel application, it also needed a weather function for tourists to plan their trips as well as the translation function

How does the product solve the problem?
Quickly, and effectively by giving the user quick translations that are clear and easy to read as well as a weather section on a website that's very easy to navigate.

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a sentence or word to translate

WHEN I write a sentence in the text area section.

THEN I am presented with options via dropdown on what language I want to translate.

WHEN I select the langauge I want to translate to & click the button to translate.

THEN I see the translation of the phrase/word/sentence clearly.

WHEN I enter the city I want to view the weather in.

THEN I am presented with the weather forecast for that country or city.


Motivation
The motivation to build this function was due to previous translating websites being slightly robotic as in most people native to the langauge being translated can tell it's a google translate and not a genuine translations, we wanted to use the most accurate API in translating phrases that come off as genuine and fit into most native's day to day speech.

What were the technologies used?
We used Bulma as the CSS framework. For the most part, it was easy to use but, however, there were small issues with the documentation as Bulma decided not to show us how their CSS is used which we then had to use siongui's method in bypassing some of their errors, he was credited in our code.

Tasks
Tasks were assigned to Mahmoud Cali in design and creating the weather API as well as local storage, Abdifatah Hassan focused on the translator API and fixing other Javascript errors.



Challenges
The idea of working with new API's was intimidating at first, there was also a lot of errors in the website such as viewport errors which we needed help to resolve, this entire project although only two weeks taught us a lot.

Success's
We were proud of how the website functioned, it does everything we want it to do the way we want it to do it, the design could be a lot better but we focused on functionality over anything else.

Directions for future development
Add a reverse function for the translation, add more languages, add a voice to text function and a text to voice function maybe too.
